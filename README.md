# C File Upload Project

## Overview
This project contains a series of C programs designed to demonstrate various algorithms and functionalities. Each program is contained within its own source file in the `src` directory. The first program, `Q_1.c`, finds the second largest number in an array of integers.

## File Structure
```

```

## Instructions
1. **Building the Programs**: 
   To compile the C programs, navigate to the `src` directory and use the following command:
   ```
   gcc Q_1.c -o Q_1
   ```
   Replace `Q_1.c` with the desired file name to compile other programs.

2. **Running the Programs**:
   After compiling, you can run the program using:
   ```
   ./Q_1
   ```
   Again, replace `Q_1` with the appropriate executable name for other programs.

## Additional Information
- Each source file (`Q_2.c` to `Q_10.c`) is expected to contain different algorithms or functionalities. The specific content for these files will be added as the project develops.
- The `.gitignore` file is included to prevent unnecessary files from being tracked by Git.

Feel free to explore the source files and modify them as needed for your learning and experimentation!
